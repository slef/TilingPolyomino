# Polyominoes: adjacency, connectivity, vertices, alignment

The basic vocabulary of polyominoes as subsets of the integer grid:

* `CellAdj` — edge-adjacency of cells.
* `CellConnected` — connectivity through paths of edge-adjacent cells.
* `IsVertex` — the grid points where the boundary of a polyomino turns.
* `VertexAligned` — all vertices on the pitch-`f` grid `fℤ × fℤ`.

This file (like all of `Polyomino/`) is tiling-free: it imports only
`TilingPolyomino.Grid` and Mathlib.

/-- A set of cells is **connected** if any two of its cells are joined by a
    path of edge-adjacent cells staying in the set.  (Named `CellConnected`
    to avoid Mathlib's topological `IsConnected`.) -/

/-- The grid point `v = (x, y)` — the lattice point at the lower-left corner
    of cell `(x, y)` — is a **vertex** of `P` if the boundary of `P` turns
    at `v`.  The four cells incident to `v` are
    SW `(x−1, y−1)`, SE `(x, y−1)`, NW `(x−1, y)`, NE `(x, y)`;
    `v` is a vertex iff the 2×2 membership pattern around `v` is constant
    neither row-wise (which would make the local boundary horizontal or
    empty) nor column-wise (vertical or empty).  Equivalently: exactly 1 or
    3 of the four incident cells lie in `P`, or exactly 2 that are
    diagonally opposite. -/
def IsVertex (P : Set Cell) (v : Cell) : Prop :=
  ¬(((v.1 - 1, v.2 - 1) ∈ P ↔ (v.1, v.2 - 1) ∈ P) ∧
    ((v.1 - 1, v.2) ∈ P ↔ (v.1, v.2) ∈ P)) ∧
  ¬(((v.1 - 1, v.2 - 1) ∈ P ↔ (v.1 - 1, v.2) ∈ P) ∧
    ((v.1, v.2 - 1) ∈ P ↔ (v.1, v.2) ∈ P))

/-- Sanity check for `IsVertex`: the vertices of a (nondegenerate) rectangle
    are exactly its four corners. -/
example (x0 y0 x1 y1 : ℤ) (hx : x0 < x1) (hy : y0 < y1) (v : Cell) :
    IsVertex (rect x0 y0 x1 y1) v ↔
      v = (x0, y0) ∨ v = (x1, y0) ∨ v = (x0, y1) ∨ v = (x1, y1) := by
  obtain ⟨x, y⟩ := v

/-- `P` is **`f`-aligned**: every vertex of `P` lies on the pitch-`f` grid
    `fℤ × fℤ`.  This is the provisional stand-in for fatness: it forces all
    boundary features of `P` to be at distance ≥ `f` from each other. -/
def VertexAligned (f : ℤ) (P : Set Cell) : Prop :=
  ∀ v : Cell, IsVertex P v → f ∣ v.1 ∧ f ∣ v.2
